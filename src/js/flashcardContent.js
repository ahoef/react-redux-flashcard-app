		question: "Will a higher or lower f/stop create a blurry background?",
		answer: "The lower the f/stop — the larger the opening in the lens — the less depth of field — the blurrier the background.",

		question: "What is aperture?",
		answer: "Aperture refers to the opening of a lens's diaphragm through which light passes. It is calibrated in f/stops and is generally written as numbers such as 1.4, 2, 2.8, 4, 5.6, 8, 11 and 16",

	},
	{
		question: "How does aperture affect shutter speed?",
		answer: "Using a low f/stop means more light is entering the lens and therefore the shutter doesn't need to stay open as long to make a correct exposure which translates into a faster shutter speed.",

		question: "What is ISO?",
		answer: "For digital photography, ISO refers to the sensitivity—the signal gain—of the camera's sensor.",

	{
		question: "How is shutter speed measured? ",
		answer: "In second fractions: 1/500, 1/250, 1/125, 1/60, 1/30, 1/15, 1/8 etc",

	{
		question: "How does focal length impact shutter speed?",
		answer: "Longer focal lengths will accentuate the amount of camera shake you have and so you’ll need to choose a faster shutter speed. ",

	{
		question: "What's the 'S' mode on a camera dial?",
		answer: "Shutter priority is very similar to aperture priority mode but is the mode where you select a shutter speed and the camera then chooses all of the other settings",

	{
		question: "What's a histogram?",
		answer: "It graphs the tones in your image from black (on the left) to white (on the right). The higher the graph at any given point the more pixels of that tone that are present in an image. Shoot for an even balance.",
